  | *-delay_auto_restore 2.5* | Adjust the lag between monitor on/off event and auto-restore to 2.5 seconds (the default lag is 1 second). This is in case the restore is incomplete or the monitor fails to go to sleep due to the restore starting too early.
  | -redraw_desktop | Redraw the whole desktop after a restore, in case some window workarea is not refreshed

  | -restore_disk_capture ["name_of_capture"] | restore windows from (named) capture on hard drive. If "name_of_capture" is omitted, the default anonymous disk capture is assumed. Note that a second restore using the same command line is needed to restore newly launched windows in the first restore.

### Webpage commander window
* A webpage commander window captures command shortcuts (which is carefully designed to be done single handedly) and translates them to the underlying web browser window, maximizing the efficiency of web browsing.

* Once activated, a tiny commander window in blue color is displayed in synchronization with the mouse cursor.
